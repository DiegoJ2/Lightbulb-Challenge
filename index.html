      <p> My name is Diego I like playing video games I've been playing them since I was very young I met a lot of people while playing video games some who i would consider some of my best friends. Another one of my hobbies is playing guitar which I haven't been doing for very long and am currently on hiatus due to one of my strings snapping. It's fun I wanna do it more.  </p>
      <p class="cringe">Please don't question the two different lightbulbs, it doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>Also guys, remember to learn the leadership creed:</p>
      <ol> 
        <li>I shall lead by example</li>
        <li>I will not lie, cheat, or steal</li>
        <li>I will think outside the box</li>
        <li>I believe in helping my neighbor and community</li>
        <li>I believe leadership is action, not position</li>
        <li>I will be a role model to young males in my community</li>
        <li>I believe nothing is hard, just a lot of work</li>
        <li>I will strive to know myself better and seek self-improvement</li>
        <li>I believe in the habit of doing more than asked for</li>
        <li>I will strive to strengthen my mind, body, and soul</li>
      </ol>
